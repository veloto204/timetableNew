## General info
Bloggersville is served by two bus companies: Posh Bus Company and Grotty Bus Company. Both
companies operate a service from the airport to the central bus stop.
The two companies have decided to produce a joint daily bus timetable. However, bus travelers find it
difficult to use the timetable because of following reasons:
1. It is difficult to search faster buses in the timetable.
2. Some of the buses run faster than others. For a frequent bus traveler it is better to miss an earlier bus
in order to catch a faster bus which departs later but reaches its destination sooner.
3. The entries in the timetable are not necessarily in order of departure time.
